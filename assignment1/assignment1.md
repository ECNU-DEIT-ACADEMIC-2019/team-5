# The Analysis of Mooc Platform
## 1.Environment
**Physical environment:** places where there is a network can be used  
**Digital environment:**  application, web platform, WeChat public number, WeChat group   
## 2.Knowledge，Skills，Attitude
There are a variety of courses on the course platform. The general curriculum framework is courseware, quizzes and assignments, exams, and discussion areas. The students' learning is mainly through quizzes and assignments.I think mooc is also like offline classroom，each class will include the cultivation of knowledge, skills and attitudes. This is the three-dimensional goal, but the implementation process may be slightly different.
### 2.1 Knowledge:  
If knowledge is classified into descriptive knowledge, normative knowledge, practical knowledge, and formal knowledge, the curriculum on the platform generally contains descriptive knowledge; some literature and philosophy, music and beauty courses convey the phenomenon or some good and bad, beautiful and ugly knowledge; practical knowledge such as design, computer programming, medical, engineering courses are learned through the creation of some projects, products; formal knowledge such as language, mathematics and logic courses is the knowledge that integrates knowledge.  
### 2.2 Skills  
Skills can be divided into mental skills and motor skills. The course content on the platform is mainly to cultivate students' mental skills. Some courses such as computer、design courses and so on can provide students with operational skills.   
### 2.3 Attitude：
In terms of emotions, the platform can be used to ask questions from teachers in the course, and can also communicate with classmates in the discussion area, and most of them can get a response.So they can get better interaction, so they will be more emotional.  
## 3.Behavior
### 3.1 classification
When studying on MOOC platform of Chinese universities, students' behaviors mainly include: watching learning resources, participating in discussions, testing and peer evaluation.  
**(1) watching learning resources:** each chapter will have corresponding teaching video, and specific chapters will have corresponding document resources, and students can watch them according to their needs. However, the learning time of video and document resources will not affect the final grades of students. However, in this platform, you can make a study plan, and according to the top-ranking plan, you can get a coupon to purchase other paid courses after you reach the required length of study.  
**(2) participate in the discussion:** students can ask questions and answer on the discussion board according to their needs. Teachers can participate in the discussion class. Some discussion sessions are set up by the teacher, and students are graded according to their participation.  
**(3) test:** it is the homework assigned by the teacher after the end of the study period. It is based on multiple choice questions, and the system automatically scores students. The highest score will be taken as the final score.  
**(4) peer review:** it refers to students' evaluation of other students' homework. The content of the homework is usually subjective. Each student should evaluate a certain amount of homework.
### 3.2 evaluation
The platform does not provide teachers with much behavioral data to be measured. In the end, the evaluation of learning effect is only based on the test scores and the degree of participation in the discussion. Most courses are recorded in advance, which cannot be timely improved to achieve better teaching effect through students' learning status. The platform has few incentive measures for students' learning, and the sustainability of students' learning mostly depends on their own willpower and learning interest.
## 4.Interaction
### 4.1 Operational interaction
#### 4.1.1 The classification of the homepage:
It has the upper and lower boundaries,was classified by course type, with the minimum divisional unit between courses. There are search engines and navigation to help students find the right course.   
What I think needs to be improved is to add a personalized push section to better meet the needs of learners.  
### 4.2 Information interaction
#### 4.2.1 Resource presentation
(1) Course guidance resources  
Comprehensive (video introduction, instructor, course overview, course evaluation, learning objectives, course chapters, preliminary knowledge, assessment criteria, certificate requirements, reference materials)  
(2) Course learning resources  
①video resource section. The video length is controlled in about 10 to 20 minutes, which satisfies the learner's fragmented learning style. Some courses insert key knowledge courseware and interactive questions, which reflects the timeliness of mastering knowledge. The video is equipped with subtitles, and the learner can adjust the speech rate, the sharpness adjustment, and the advance and retreat adjustment; however, the video cannot be positioned according to the subtitle, nor can the video download link be provided.  
②learning materials. Available as a presentation or as a PDF document.  
#### 4.2.2 Teaching organization
Course Segment Distribution: Announcement / Courseware (Video & Document) / Quiz & Assignment / Exam / Discussion Board.  
Each lesson generally follows the following steps: the teacher regularly publishes instructional videos, arranges practice assignments/ organizes topic discussions/ students watch videos to complete homework exercises.  
#### 4.2.3 Platform interaction
Set up four discussion areas, namely: all discussion areas, teacher answering areas, exchange areas, and comprehensive discussion areas. Learners can post topics and search by keyword subject, reply, and comment. Each topic sets the latest post, last reply, number of replies, and number of votes.  
In this process, there are both teacher-student interactions and interactions between students. In general, teachers have played an active role in the entire interaction, but most of the learners are still in the role of marginal participation, and participation is very low.  
In addition, most of the interactions on the platform belong to asynchronous interactions, and it is hoped that a section of synchronous interaction can be added. Each course can be arranged twice for teachers' online Q&A (one in the middle, one before the end of the course). Each time does not need to be too long, mainly to solve the problems and difficulties of most students. This will not only help the learner's knowledge consolidation, but also enhance the social network relationship of the course.  
### 4.3 Conceptual interaction
This is about the students' interaction between new and old knowledge on their own. Students' assimilation and construction of knowledge are generated between the brains and are difficult to quantify.   
First, I think that the platform can help to record the learner's learning path, present the learner's learning report in real time, and help the learner master his own learning progress and knowledge.  
In addition, a “note area” can be added to allow students to quickly record knowledge points while watching videos, so that they can be organized after class.  
## 5.Experience
### 5.1 Sensory experience
The visual elements of the platform are standardized and easy to identify. The video and audio play clearly and smoothly. During the learning process, learners don’t feel obvious discomfort or strong sensory impact.
### 5.2 Learning experience
#### 5.2.1 course learning
The course resources on the MOOC platform are useful. It has a wealth of course resources to meet the needs of various subjects, and has carried out cooperation with many top universities to provide high-quality content. Besides, these courses are very systematic, which can provide learners with continuous courses knowledge.
#### 5.2.2 information management
Firstly, the learning platform pushes notification every week to inform learners of course content, the deadline of assignment and encourage them to keep studying. Secondly, the platform allows learners to follow official accounts or submit an email to learn about their learning process and gain a reminder of the course progress. Thirdly, it remains learning record. When entering the home page, learners can begin from where they left off last time conveniently.  
### 5.3 Interactive experience
#### 5.3.1 Navigation 
The information about courses and learning process is findable. The navigation function ensures learners can switch to the part they need quickly.
#### 5.3.2 Discussion and Share
Learners can share ideas and questions with other learners of this course. Discussion area can be divided into teacher q&a area, classroom communication area and comprehensive discussion area. The first one is to put questions about homework, tests and courseware which needs to be solved by teachers; the second one publishes the discussion of the course teaching content; the last one can post any experience and ideas related to the course, study, work and life,etc. And learners can also share the courses with others through WeChat, QQ and Weibo.
#### 5.3.3 Personalization
Although learners can decide on their course and learning process freely, the recommender system can be more personalized. Influenced by massive course information, MOOC learners tend to lose the depth of learning and stay in shallow learning. In addition, learners have different learning motivations and learning results. While the platform lacks of a more personalized recommender system, which fails to promote personalized learning of different learners.
## 6.Interact object
